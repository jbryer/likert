* Fixed bug where text.color parameter was not being used.
* Fixed bug 16.

  missing levels in an item.
* Added text labels to the histogram (if include.histogram=TRUE) for the n.
* Fixed a bug where plot.likert(..., include.histogram=TRUE) would not work with a group and only one item (i.e. one column).
* Updates for newer version of R and Roxygen.

likert 1.1
=========

Released September 25, 2013.

* New density plot type plot(l, type='density').
* xtable function to create LaTeX and HTML tables.
* Added several parameters related to centering bar plots. Can now include the
  center level and split across zero, or specify which level, or between which
  levels, centering occurs.
* Plot a histogram of responses (n) alongside the barplot.
* Summary function now includes neutral column. Values will be NA if no level
  is the center.
* If there is a neutral category in the bar plot it will be labeled with its
  percentage.
* Added parameter to wrap text in plots for long item names.
* Changed the default colors.
* Added parameter to change legend title.
* Can now plot bar plot panels horizontally.
* Changed the center=TRUE as the default for bar plots to.
* Added panel.flip to flip the placement of grouping elements and items.
* Added legend.position parameter.
* Added panel.strip.color to change the background color for panel labels.
* Added group.order to reorder how groups are plotted. This also works for items in
  non-grouped items.
* Added parameters to turn off percent labels for low, high, and netural separately.
* Added a check to ensure all factors have the same number of levels.
* Items (i.e columns) that are not a factor will be converted to a factor using as.factor.
* Added reverse.levels function to reverse code factors. Useful when you wish to plot
  bars in reverse order (left-to-right).
* Two new demos, RecodeFactors and UnusedLevels show how to deal with common data
  issues before using the likert function.
* Added plot.percents parameter to label each category.
* Other bug fixes.
