ConfidenceIntervals	This demo shows how to superimpose confidence intervals to likert plots.
GroupedFactors	This demo shows how to group by factors (i.e. group columns together).
likert 	This demo creates likert plots for the PISA data.
mass	This demo shows how to create a likert plot using data from the Math Anxiety Scale Survey.
PreSummarized 	This demo shows how to use the likert package with presummarized data.
RecodeFactors 	This demo shows how to recode likert items. This is useful if you wish to reverse the order from left-to-right how the likert responses are plotted or change the labels of responses (e.g. from numeric values to character values).
UnusedLevels 	This demo shows how to address the "All items (columns) must have the same number of levels" error that occurs when the items passed to likert do not have the same number of levels.
GapAnalysis 	This demo shows how to perform a gap analysis where each item has two repsonses for satisfaction and importance.
