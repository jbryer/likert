\title{Creates a density plot for likert items.}
\usage{
likert.density.plot(likert, facet = TRUE, bw = 0.5, legend, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{likert}{object of type likert.}

\item{facet}{for non-grouped items, should each density distribution be plotted
in a separate facet.}

\item{bw}{the smoothing bandwidth. This is often set to the standard deviation
but this is often inadequate for Likert type items. The value of 0.5
is used since the difference between any two adjacent levels is one.}

\item{legend}{title for the legend.}

\item{...}{parameters passed to \code{\link{density}}.}
}
\description{
This funciton will create a visualization that treats the likert items as
a continuous variable.
