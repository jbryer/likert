\arguments{
\item{x}{likert class object.}

\item{caption}{the table caption.}

\item{label}{the table label.}

\item{align}{column alignments.}

\item{digits}{number of digits to use for numeric columns.}

\item{display}{column formats.}

\item{auto}{Logical, indicating whether to apply automatic format when no 
value is passed to align, digits, or display (see \code{\link{xtable}}
for more information.}

\item{include.n}{option to include n}

\item{include.mean}{option to include mean}

\item{include.sd}{option to include sd}

\item{include.low}{option to include low}

\item{include.neutral}{option to include neutral}

\item{include.high}{option to include high}

\item{include.levels}{option to include levels}

\item{include.missing}{option to include missing levels.}

\item{center}{specifies which level should be treated as the center. For example,
\code{center = 3} would use the third level as the center whereas
\code{center = 3.5} would indicate no specific level is the center but
<= 3 are low levels and >= 4 are high levels (i.e. used for forced choice 
items or those without a neutral option). This also influences which levels
are summarized in the low and high groups.}

\item{ordered}{whether the results should be ordered. See \code{\link{summary.likert}}}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to \link{xtable}.}
}
